//        Imagine youâ€™ve been given data representing how long items have sat in a warehouse. Your
//        job is to categorize them by time in the warehouse. Items can be classified as 0, 1, 2 or 3.
//        Items in class 0 are less than 89 days old. Class 1 = 90-179 days, Class 2 = 180-269 days,
//        Class 3 = 270-364 days. For the given warehouse wait times: 13, 49, 90, 130, 175, 181,
//        255, 310, 330, 359, write a class similar to Exercise 3 above, that has a next() method that
//        can be called 10 times and outputs a number representing the classification of each
//        number in the set of ages above. Example: an item waiting for 5 days would return 0 and
//        an item waiting 92 days would return 1.
