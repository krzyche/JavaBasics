//2. Use TDD to write tests for a method that can take a String input like:
//        “Billy, Bob, 1234 Big St., Big City, California, 90210”
//        And return an Object representing that person. You can name your class Exercise2 or
//        Person or whatever you like. To test this easily, you’ll need to have the IDE generate an
//        equals() & hashcode() method in your class that models a Person (you’ll learn more
//        about that in a later section). To do so, you can right click on an empty line within your
//        class and select, “Generate…” and click “Next” every time (probably will be three times)
//        followed by “Finish”. You’ll now be able to continue with your test(s).
//        1. Modify your method to accept a String like:
//        “Billy, Bob, 1234 Big St., Big City, California, 90210 | Joe,Smith,5678 Little St., Little
//        City, New York, 20109”
//        Your new method should return an array of Objects that model a Person. You should
//        reuse the same Person class you used before (whatever you named it). The text input
//        should separate the details of people by the pipe symbol ‘ | ’. There should be no limit
//        on the number of people details you can pass in on one String. In the example String
//        above, I present only two people, but you could keep adding a | symbol and more
//        people details and you should get back an array with that many people objects in it. Try
//        to reuse what you already did for the ﬁrst part of this exercise and just build on top of it.
